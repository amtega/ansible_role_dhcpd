dhcpd_subnets: []

# List of dicts with the hosts declarations. Each dict must follow this format

dhcpd_hosts: []

# Delete unmanaged host config files if found. If true the role will delete
# all files in the dhcpd_hosts_include_dir directory that are not part of the
# dhcpd_hosts variable. If you intend to setup some config files from
# other hosts different from the dhcpd server itself is better to leave this
# value in false

dhcpd_delete_unmanaged: no

# Tells the role to run only the hosts configuration related tasks, assuming
# that the server was previously configured in other role run. This is useful
# when you want to reduce role processing time when adding hosts only
